<p> Based in the Kingdom of Amalur, this amazingly set out game with its visually appeling graphics is one to remeber.</p>
<p> You play as a charactor of ether human, light fae, dark fae or high human. You are fateless and con choose between going into one of 3 teirs, Brawller, Rouge, Mage or stay fateless. Each of these have their different perks... Brawller, are strong, have more heath and like hand to hand fighting. Rouges are ranged fighters who prefure a bow and arrows. and a Mage relies on magic much mroe that brute strenght, they trick their enemys and kill them with their magic.</p>
<p> You are the hero of Amalur, and are one of the few to be revived before the badguys take over the whole kingdom.</p>
<p> There is a viriety of different weapons, some used with magic and some not, to see the full list of these go to the <a heref="https://www./html/">Weapons</a> page.</p>
<p> This is an open world game with, a main quest, and alot of sidde quests to keep you going for days cause it sure did to me. There are quests you can pick up on your adventure arount Amalur, with different rewards too, coins, weapons, jewerly, and sometimes a hpuse of to. You cann steal from people but dont do it when anyones looking, becuse there is a very good chance you would go to jail.</p>
